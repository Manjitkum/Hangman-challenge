# Trexquant Hangman Challenge Submission

Candidate: Manjit Kumar  
Institute: Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati  
Position Applied For: Global Alpha Researcher  

## Objective  
The goal of this challenge was to develop an original algorithm to solve the Hangman game with maximum possible accuracy, ideally exceeding 60%, without relying on traditional n-gram based models.

## Methodology  
- Utilized the provided training dictionary (`words_250000_train.txt`).  
- Implemented a filtering mechanism to narrow down candidate words based on current guesses and known patterns.  
- Selected next guesses by analyzing letter frequency distribution among filtered candidates.  
- The approach is heuristic and rule-based without incorporating formal machine learning or neural network models.

## Results  
- Executed 1000 final evaluation games (`practice=0`).  
- Achieved an overall success rate of approximately 56.6%.

## Submission Contents  
- `hangman_solution.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete implementation and evaluation results.  
- `words_250000_train.txt`: Dictionary file used for word filtering.  
- `README.md`: This document.

## Declaration  
This submission is an original work authored solely by me. No part of the code has been copied from external sources.
